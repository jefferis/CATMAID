"""
This is a monkey patch for django-rest-swagger 0.3.4 to improve grouping of
API endpoints into Swagger resources. This patch removes a case where an
endpoint would create a new root path even if another one matched. For
example, if these two paths existed:

    /{pk1}/resource
    /{pk1}/resource/method

root paths for both would be created, although the second endpoint would
be an endpoint in both.

Instead, use the smallest set of endpoints covering the entire path tree
as the root paths and Swagger resources.

This monkey patch can be applied with the patch() function, after all
Django applications are loaded.
